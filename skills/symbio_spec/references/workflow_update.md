# Update Symbiospec as the software changes

Read the affected approved specifications before implementation. Use the user's development request to determine the authorized product change, and identify which concepts, behaviours, interface descriptions, styling conventions, platform requirements, or overview relationships are affected.

Update the corresponding Symbiospec content in the same development task. Keep unchanged product meaning unchanged, and maintain affected links and indexes. Technical refactoring with no product-level effect needs no artificial specification edit; say that no relevant specification change was found when useful.

Existing authorization applies. If the work exposes additional product decisions, prepare those decisions together for review. Apply authorized updates without asking again, and preserve unresolved proposals separately. An implementation mistake or unexpected test result does not authorize a changed product requirement.

Record meaningful decisions and coverage changes using the detected format. In `2.0.0`, follow the [decision writing and summary maintenance procedure](format-v2.0.0.md#422-indexes-and-topic-summaries): mark affected topics before writing, preserve earlier records, update date indexes, topic summaries and approval links, then mark summaries current last. Use the [reading procedure](format-v2.0.0.md#423-reading-procedure) to locate relevant original evidence without reading the complete history. In `1.0.0`, continue maintaining the single decision file; do not migrate implicitly. Run checks appropriate to the actual implementation and documentation change. Summarize the resulting product difference, affected specification, verification performed, and remaining uncertainty.
